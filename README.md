# Monorepo test

## Getting started

Do a `git clone https://github.com/johnparn/monorepo-setup`.

Go to root folder and do `yarn`.


## Start storybook

`yarn start`

## Run tests

`yarn test`

Doing a 'yarn dev' will run the tests in watch mode. However, when running the tests with `--watch`the intial coverage report s a bit confusing. https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/2256.
